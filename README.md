# connectome-ontogenesis
Generative model of the spatiotemporal development of neuronal networks

# Description

This set of functions allows the simulation of the spatiotemporal development of synthetic neuronal networks (connectomes). The generative model aims at mimicking the development of neuronal networks and explaining the intricate topology of such neuronal networks solely based on two fundamental dimensions, that is, space and time. The core idea is that the mere fact that neuronal networks are inhabiting space and time, these fundamental dimensions pose in and by themselves contraints on the formation of conenctions and thus result in non-trivial intricate topologies observed in empirical biological neuronal networks. 

The synthetic neuronal networks generated from this model can be subsequently directly and quantitevely compared with empirical biological neuronal networks connectomes, since such comparisons were explicitly taken into account in the design of the generative model. Therefore, this neurobiologically-informed generative model can elucidate to what extent the observed empirical "adult" connectomes can be understood in light of the parsimonious neurodevelopmental mechanism that this generative model instantiates.
