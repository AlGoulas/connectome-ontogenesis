# connectome-ontogenesis
Generative model of the spatiotemporal development of connectomes

This set of functions allows the simulation of the spatiotemporal development of brain connectomes. The synthetic connectomes can be subsequently compared with empirical brain connectomes from diverse species. 

Thus, this neurobiologically-informed generative model can elucidate to what extent the observed adult connectomes can be understood in light of the parsimonious neurodevelopmental mechanism that the model instantiates.
